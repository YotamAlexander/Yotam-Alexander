I am a PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, fortunate to be advised by Nadav Cohen.

My research interests broadly include the theoretical foundations of modern machine learning. I aim to develop theory that explains how, why and when neural networks work, and apply it to improve their performance in practice.
